# Click_Sense: Predicting Ad-Click Behavior

**Overview:**

Click Sense is a machine learning project aimed at predicting user ad-click behavior using demographic and behavioral data. By applying Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting, the project provides actionable insights to optimize digital marketing strategies and improve ROI. Logistic Regression proved the most effective model, offering a balance of accuracy, precision, and interpretability.

**Dataset and Preparation:**

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, with features such as Age, Area Income, Daily Internet Usage, and Gender. Irrelevant columns were removed, and the data was standardized to enhance model performance.

**Findings and Insights:**

Older users are more likely to click on ads, with features like Daily Time Spent on Site and Area Income also playing a role. Logistic Regression achieved 97.25% accuracy and a low false positive rate, making it ideal for targeted ad campaigns.

**Future Directions:**

The project can be expanded with advanced personalization, A/B testing, and more detailed behavioral data to enhance predictive accuracy and ROI.
